      "message": "We could require URIs for paths (eg. file:///path/to/dir), but I quite like that we can have \u0027-\u0027 mean stdin/stdout.\n\nWe could go the other way around and require URIs for Lustre (eg. mdt://fsname-MDT0001), but it doesn\u0027t feel quite right to decide for Lustre how MDTs should be addressed.\n\nAll in all, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that bad. Technically, you could have files named \u0027-\u0027 and yet it\u0027s never really a problem, is it? Also, even if you do have files whose name conflicts with an MDT, unless they are yaml files that contain valid fsevents, rbh-fsevents will error out. To fix the issue, all you have to do is move to a directory where there is no name conflict.\n\nI\u0027d prefer we table this issue until support for Lustre is implemented. Ideally with some input from the Lustre community.",

      "message": "Re: file named -, usually `-- -` is interpretted as the file, as well as `./-` (probably safer and works for rbh-fsevents without any code)\n\nRe: lustre -- I actually didn\u0027t think of using uri for that. How would you distinguish a file:// that points to a yaml file vs. a file:// that points to a fs root for fanotify? But I guess that when we already are using the uri hammer everywhere every option looks like an uri nail :D\n(I was just thinking a toggle e.g. --lustre, --yaml etc with default being yaml?)\n\nanyway, agreed it can wait.",
