      "message": "(Since Quentin didn\u0027t reply) it\u0027s most definitely not needed, and actually probably doesn\u0027t change anything in this function.\nIn others e.g. parse_statx_mapping later on he fits four bools in a single such struct, which optimizes size a bit (the :1 is a \"bitfield\" saying each field only takes one bit, so up to 8 bools can fit in a single byte)\n\nIt\u0027s mostly used for structs with lots of flags to replace bit flags and explicit bitwise manipulation for readability.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027d have bothered for on-stack values but I guess why not :)",
