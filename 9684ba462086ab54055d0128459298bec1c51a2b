      "message": "(On a very loaded server it should be possible to have a different changelog date vs. date of file? if the second mark passed between the two; but I guess as a first approx this is more than good enough and better than querying the server if we don\u0027t have to. If we do have an enrich step though I\u0027d request it to get a fresh timestamp for principle, I don\u0027t think that costs any extra work for the client/servers)",
