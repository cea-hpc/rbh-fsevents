Doesn\u0027t look like lustre cares.\n\nWell I guess we don\u0027t really need to handle that and there is no `strrstr` anyway, but my question is more: what is this trying to do?\nI assume I\u0027ll understand when reviewing the later/earlier patches (note to self: top of the list in gerrit open changes isn\u0027t the top of the stack...), but ideally you shouldn\u0027t have to guess that it\u0027s an MDT name -- you\u0027ll have to error anyway if it\u0027s an mdt that doesn\u0027t exist, so like \u0027fopen(arg, \"r\") you should try to \"open\" an MDT with this name without restriction in my opinion; the checks below are incomplete and in my opinion harmful.",
