Doesn\u0027t look like lustre cares.\n\nWell I guess we don\u0027t really need to handle that and there is no `strrstr` anyway, but my question is more: what is this trying to do?\nI assume I\u0027ll understand when reviewing the later/earlier patches (note to self: top of the list in gerrit open changes isn\u0027t the top of the stack...), but ideally you shouldn\u0027t have to guess that it\u0027s an MDT name -- you\u0027ll have to error anyway if it\u0027s an mdt that doesn\u0027t exist, so like \u0027fopen(arg, \"r\") you should try to \"open\" an MDT with this name without restriction in my opinion; the checks below are incomplete and in my opinion harmful.",

      "message": "Yeah, you\u0027re right.\n\nI\u0027m thinking of multiple ways to better manage this. The first one is to force the user to indicate which kind of reader they wants to use, to avoid trying everyone of them. In this case, we let the program fail if the right `source_init()` fails.\n\n # rbh-fsevents --reader lustre lustre-MDT0000 -\n\nOr overloading rbh-fsevents for a lustre usage, but this may be overkill.\n \nThe second one is to replace those checks by trying to read `/dev/changelog-%s`, with `%s` the device name. This is the first step of `llapi_changelog_start()`.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "I was thinking the later (just try to open the changelog and fail if it doesn\u0027t exist); there might be problems when multiple match (e.g. a filename exists with same name but you wanted the changelog) though.\nThe usual \"solution\" for that is to try to open everything (file, changelog etc) and decide based on result, emitting a warning if multiple existed. That\u0027s a bit more work though, probably not needed if everyhing is clear.\n\nNow I\u0027m thinking back about it the processing itself is quite different if it\u0027s lustre, so having --lustre probably makes more sense. What lustre does and what reading a file does is quite different... I\u0027ll also eventually want (Quentin planned to do it before he got overworked :P) a fanotify backend for rbh-fsevents and that\u0027ll take a directory in parameter... I think making it clear what we\u0027re trying to do is probably better?\nWe can always add heuristics (trying to guess) later if that turns out to be annoying to use.",
