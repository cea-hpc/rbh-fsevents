But in this case actually what\u0027s the advantage of binary over RBH_VT_INT32?\nIf you store the value as binary you\u0027ll need to start worrying about endianness (because yes why not run an enricher on a remote machine with a different architecture, what could possibly go wrong!), whereas int meaning stays stable when serialized",
