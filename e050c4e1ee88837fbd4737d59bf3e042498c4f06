      "message": "(nitpick) admittedly not very costly but this is parsing uri three times.. I wonder if it\u0027d make senes for rbh_backend_from_uri to take a raw uri instead, then you could just pass it as argument to sink_from_uri?\n\nAnswering myself: other places using rbh_backend_from_uri don\u0027t seem to do quite as many check, this could likely be lazy and just check for \"rbh:\" prefix and pass string as is -- or since it\u0027s last in the function just pass it as is anyway, it checks for RBH_SCHEME itself too and will error out just the same.\n(anyway, doesn\u0027t matter)",
