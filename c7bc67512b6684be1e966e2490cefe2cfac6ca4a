      "message": "(style) I don\u0027t think that goto helps understanding, setting process_step to 1 here and returning directly is probably easier to follow as nothing else points to save_event.\nOr will there be more multistep events with other changelogs? in which case we should set process_step\u003d0 after end_event. It\u0027s just not really coherent to have one here and the other at the bottom.",

      "message": "There will be more multistep events.\n\nI totally agree with the process_step set to 0, so I moved it to the beginning instead (when we check that there is no previous record saved, so we know this is the first time w will manage the new one). I can, as you suggested, move it to the bottom, but that means I will need to initialize it when building the iterator (which is not an issue at all). As you wish :).",
